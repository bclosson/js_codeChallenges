# JavaScript Code Challenges

## Set Up

1. Fork this repo into your GHE account by clicking the **[Fork]** button in the top-right of the page.

2. Since you cannot have nested repos, be sure to move outside of the class, or any other repo before the next step.

3. To bring the materials in the repo into your computer, clone *your fork* of the repo by copying the URL shown when you click the **[Clone or download]**: `$ git clone <the copied URL>`

4. Slack your instructors the link to your fork so that they can monitor your progress.

## Instructions

- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 

- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To prevent this, click on the **Options** button on the near the top-right of the page and uncheck the _run tests in random order_ checkbox.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.  **DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILE.**

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- Be sure to name the function **exactly** as specified by the challenge.

- The default display shows only the challenges that are failing. To see an overall summary of all tests, click the "**Spec List**" link.

- After solving a challenge, be sure to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.js`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".

## Committing and Pushing your Work

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. As you solve the challenges, commit your work, and `$ git push origin master`. This pushes the updates to your fork.
